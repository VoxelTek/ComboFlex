# ComboFlex

### What is this?
The Wii is a complex console, with lots of different parts. A lot of those are optional, but a lot are necessary, which makes things annoying when trying to trim down a Wii for use in a portable gaming console. Not to mention, the optional extras can often be quite a pain to include.

As such, the community has developed multiple assistive PCBs. This project aims to combine all of them onto one flexible PCB, to not only make things easier for modders, but also to reduce costs some.

The projects in question:
- WiFi-Flex, by supertazon and YveltalGriffin: https://github.com/supertazon/WiFiflex
- mxHound, by VoxelTek: https://github.com/VoxelTek/mxHound
- fujiFlex, by YveltalGriffin: https://github.com/mackieks/fujiflex

This project also implements NAND relocation as a bonus feature. While other projects already exist for that, most aren't licensed very permissively. As such, the NAND relocation will be reconstructed from scratch.
